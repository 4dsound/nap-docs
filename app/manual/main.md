Welcome
=======================

Welcome to the developer's reference of the [4DSOUND Engine](https://4dsound.net/Software). The `4DSOUND Engine` is a stand-alone spatial sound application developed in C++ using the [NAP Framework](https://github.com/napframework). It includes a data-driven modular framework for particle-based sound objects, spatial sound effects and transformations, controlled in real-time over OSC and visualised using a 3D graphical interface. The 4DSOUND Engine is optimised for low-latency performance with large numbers of sound sources.
